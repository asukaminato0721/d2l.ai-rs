# d2l in candle

to help myself get familiar with basic ideas.



```sh
cargo test -r -- --nocapture
```

## TODO

- [x] use `assert_eq!` instead of `println!`
- [ ] learn from the [candle-transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/candle/tree/main/candle-transformers)

---

## Notes

[This page](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn/blob/main/crates/burn-candle/src/ops/module.rs) gives the operation that candle doesn't support. Which I need to write by hand afterwards.
